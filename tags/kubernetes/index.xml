      <description>A local volume represents a mounted local storage device such as a disk, partition or directory. Local volumes can only be used as a statically created PersistentVolume. Dynamic provisioning is not supported. Compared to hostPath volumes, local volumes are used in a durable and portable manner without manually scheduling pods to nodes. The system is aware of the volume&amp;rsquo;s node constraints by looking at the node affinity on the PersistentVolume.</description>

      <description>Challenge Nearly all requests to Vault must be accompanied by an authentication token. This includes all API requests, as well as via the Vault CLI and other libraries. If you can securely get the first secret from an originator to a consumer, all subsequent secrets transmitted between this originator and consumer can be authenticated with the trust established by the successful distribution and user of that first secret.
The applications running in a Kubernetes environment is no exception.</description>
